  /*
   *  REGISTER FILE - rf.v
   *
   *  Inputs:
   *   - read_rega (4 bits): Address to be read for RA.
   *   - read_regb (4 bits): Address to be read for RB.
   *   - write_reg (4 bits): Address of register to be written to when rf_we
   *        is set to 1.
   *   - write_data (32 bits): Data to write to register write_reg when rf_we
   *        is set to 1.
   *   - rf_we: Write enable. When this is set to 1, the data on write_data
   *        is copied into register write_reg.
   *
   *  Outputs:
   *     NOTE - rsa and rsb latch the selected register file contents on the
   *     positive edge of the clock.
   *   - rsa (32 bits): Contents of register read_rega. Note that R0 is always
   *        read as 0x00000000, for both RA and RB.
   *   - rsb (32 bits): Contents of register read_regb.
